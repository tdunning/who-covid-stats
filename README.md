# WHO Covid-19 Statistics

This repository contains data files that represent the total and within-China case counts for COVID-19 
cases extracted from the WHO daily situation reports. In addition, I digitized the graph from the original
NY Times article on growth rates for comparison.

I also include a very simple visualization of total and incremental case counts. On the graph with the total
cases, I have overlaid two different exponential growth models that illustrate how early isolation measures were
progressively more effective.
